# Gym Hearts

This is an experimental library for hearts poker game and reinforment learning.
I implement the library and run it at ubuntu and mac by python3.
If you encounter any problem, feel free to create new issue on this project :smile:


# Implemented Rules

1. All heart cards ( 2♥, 3♥, …., Q♥, K♥, A♥ ) cost 1 score
2. Q♠ costs 13 score
3. This trick’s looser will be next trick’s first player

# Installation

```sh
pip3 install gym-hearts
```

# Hello World

```python
import gym
from gymhearts import env as hearts_env
from gymhearts import strategy


class HelloStrategy(strategy.IStrategy):

    def move(self, observation):
        action = observation['valid_hand_cards'][0]
        return action


env = hearts_env.HeartsEnv()
env.add_player(HelloStrategy())
env.add_player(HelloStrategy())
env.add_player(HelloStrategy())
env.add_player(HelloStrategy())
env.start()
env.render()
observation = env.get_observation()
done = False
while not done:
    action = env.move()
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
```
